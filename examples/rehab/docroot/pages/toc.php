<br>
14. Governing Law
<br>
These Terms of Use will be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, without reference to their rules regarding conflicts of law.
<br>
15. Arbitration
<br>
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH Rehab-Connect AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.
<br>
You and Rehab-Connect agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms of Use or relating to the Site and Site Materials, except that you and Rehab-Connect are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FORM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and Rehab-Connect agree: (i) to notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises; (ii) to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; (iii) that any arbitration will occur in Orange County, California; and (iv) that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association. You and Rehab-Connect also agree that the state or federal courts in Santa Clara County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Rehab-Connect will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.
<br>
16. California Use Only
<br>
The Site is controlled and operated by Rehab-Connect from its offices in the State of California. Rehab-Connect makes no representation that any of the materials or the services to which you have been given access are available or appropriate for use in other locations. Your use of or access to the Site should not be construed as Rehab-Connect's purposefully availing itself of the benefits or privilege of doing business in any state or jurisdiction other than California.
<br>
17. Severability and Waiver
<br>
If, for whatever reason, a court of competent jurisdiction finds any term or condition in these Terms of Use to be unenforceable, all other terms and conditions will remain unaffected and in full force and effect. No waiver of any breach of any provision of these Terms of Use will constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof, and no waiver will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.
<br>
18. Modifications
<br>
Rehab-Connect may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, (a) revise these Terms of Use; (b) modify the Site, or any features or portions thereof; and (c) discontinue the Site, or any features or portions thereof, at any time. Rehab-Connect will post any revision to these Terms of Use to the Site, and the revision will be effective immediately on such posting.
